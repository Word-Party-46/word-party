Word Party
Client Brief

Project description
The client is writing their first poetry collection but unfortunately has run into some snags when it comes to inspiration! They would like an app to help them expand their vocabulary and assist with creating rhymes.

Requirements
Uses the Datamuse API (https://www.datamuse.com/api/) and Firebase.
Users can enter a word and then select what functionality they would like performed on that word, either: find rhymes for that word, or find words similar to it.
The app will then call the Datamuse API to perform the specified search.
The results will be displayed in a visually pleasing manner.
The user will be presented with the ability to search again with a new word.
Users can create an ‘in progress poem’ in firebase where they can save their words.
Users should also be able to view these word collections.
Proper error handling. For example:
If a user types in a query that yields no result - they should be provided feedback (e.g. there were no results found).
Common error responses should be handled.
API loading states.

Stretch goals
Explore the Datamuse API and see if it has other functionality that could assist the client with poetry writing.
Allow users to edit and/or remove words from their collections.
Create authenticated users so that users can save their collections of words away from the public eye.

Deliverables
Project files up on GitHub.
Project up on Netlify.
All requirements completed BEFORE any stretch goals have been attempted.
